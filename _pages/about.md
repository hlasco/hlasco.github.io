I am currently a research engineer in the INRIA [AIRSEA team](https://team.inria.fr/airsea/en/), working in multidisciplinary projects involving deep learning for fluid dynamics and climate modeling. I graduated from the [ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/) in 2019, where I studied theoretical physics. Over the past years, I have developped expertise in high performance computing, machine learning and numerical simulations.
